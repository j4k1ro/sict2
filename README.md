# sict2

## Description
I created this Python script, as a hobby, to get the lunch menu of my university's canteen from the command-line. It reduces a few clicks and time needed to get the same data using traditional web browsers.

`sict2`: **S**odexo's canteen at my university's **ICT** department, lunch menu getter version **2**.

## Usage
```
Usage: python sict2.py [-s yyyy/mm/dd]
```
This script works with `python 3.6+`
